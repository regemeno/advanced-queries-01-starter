Our salespeople have discretion to use discounts in order to make a sale
if they think it warranted. Management would like to know which
salespeople are using discounts. We're a little worried that the
salespeople are being overly generous and that offering a discount should
somehow diminish the bonuses we pay to salespeople.

Your results should look as follows
