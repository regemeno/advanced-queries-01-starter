For this assignment we'll be using the `south_seas` schema, which contains
data describing the state of a hypothetical company called "South Seas".
(Some of the problems in this assignment are taken from a book. But, the
solutions are not in that book. ðŸ˜œ)

Weâ€™d like to see just the `first_name`, `last_name`, and `hire_date`
of all the employees with the title of "Sales Representative".

Write a SQL statement that returns only those employees.

Your results should look like this

```
 first_name | last_name | hire_date

Janet      | Leverling | 2019-04-21
Margaret   | Peacock   | 2019-04-21
Michael    | Suyama    | 2019-04-18
