OK, we're going to have a little sales contest.  ðŸ’µðŸ“ˆ First prize is a
Cadillac Eldorado. Anyone want to see second prize? Second prize is a set
of steak knives.  Third prize is you're fired.

Please rank our sales persons by their aggregate sales in 2021.  Give the
`employee_id`, `first_name`, `last_name` and `sales` total in descending
order. Make sure you account for discounts customers received (as
indicated in the `order_details` table). The discounts are fractional
prices, so a discount of `0.25` means a customer paid 75% of the price,
that is 1 - 0.25 = 0.75.
 
Your results should look as follows

```
employee_id | first_name | last_name |       sales
