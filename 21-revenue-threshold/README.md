OMG. We realized that we've made over a million dollars in 
revenue. Woot! Crud, we should have had a party ðŸ¥³ to celebrate.
Well, we're going to do that that now. But, out of curiosity,
we'd like to know on what day we should have held our party.
On what day did our total revenue (in the history of the company)
exceed $1M?

You might want to look at [PostgreSQL window functions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/tutorial-window.html).

Your results should look as follows

```
party_date
------------
2020-12-02

* Add hint on `highest-freight-charges` regarding finding the most
  recent 12mo of data.
* Clarify `end-of-month-orders`. The "last week" means the "last seven days".

* Add that `orders-to-latin-america` should be sorted by `order_id`
