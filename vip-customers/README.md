We want to send a nice letter to our top ten customers
in 2020. Please find those customers listing their
`customer_id`, `contact_name`, and the `sales` figures
for those customers in descending order for 2020.
You should not include discounts that the customers
received (if any) on their orders.

Your results should look as follows
```
